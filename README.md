## Description 

This is a project done as an exercise for my university. This program can compress a text file using the Huffman compression algorithm. 
You can find documentation on this method of compression [here](https://www.ic.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg121/Source-Coding_WS12/selected-readings/10_04051119.pdf).

### Technologies

You can run this program with Python 3.8.
No dependencies are required.

---
## How to use

This program is used in  command line.
To use, you just need to use this command : 
`python3 main.py`

You will then be prompted to put the name of the file you wish to compress.
```
Which file do you wish to compress ? text_file.txt
```
There are 2 outputs for this program : 
- The compressed file : `text_file_comp.bin`
- The alphabet file used to decompress the file : `text_file_freq.txt` 

You will then have the result of the entire process.
```
File compressed successfully
Compression rate : 52.77777777777778%
Average bit count : 4.1875
```

### Installation

You just need to clone the project to a directory : 

`git clone https://github.com/TheDiscordDude/HuffmanCompression/`
